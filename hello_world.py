# These are comments, it is a good idea to always add some to explain what the code is supposed to be doing
# Week 1 Assigment 4
# Write a code that computes the hyperbolic sine using three different formulas and numpy functions/constants. 
# Expected outcome: when testing for x = 2 \pi the results should be 267.74489404101644, 267.74489404101644, and 267.7448940410163
